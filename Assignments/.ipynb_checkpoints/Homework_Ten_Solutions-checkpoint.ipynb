    "#### First Proof:\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if we look at $s_{n}$, we see that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_{n} = \\inf\\left\\{ \\left\\{a_{k}\\right\\}_{k=n+1}^{\\infty} \\right\\}= \\inf\\left\\{ a_{n+1}\\cup \\left\\{a_{k}\\right\\}_{k=n+2}^{\\infty}\\right\\} \\leq \\inf\\left\\{ \\left\\{a_{k}\\right\\}_{k=n+2}^{\\infty}\\right\\} = s_{n+1}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Given that we suppose that $a_{n}$ is bounded, i.e. $\\exists M\\gt 0$ such that $|a_{n}|\\leq M$ for all $n\\geq 1$, then since \n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_{n} \\leq a_{k}, ~ k\\gt n \n",
    "$$\n",
    "then $s_{n}\\lt M$ for all $n$.  Thus, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, we must have that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = \\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty}s_{n}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Thus, for say $\\epsilon/2$, there must exist some $N$ such that $|s_{n}-S|\\lt \\epsilon/2$ for $n\\gt N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, for each $s_{n}$, by Proposition 3.7.1, there must exist some subsequence $a_{k_{j}}$, $k_{j}\\gt n$ such that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lim_{j\\rightarrow \\infty} a_{k_{j}} = s_{n}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Thus, taking $n\\gt N$ from above, for $\\epsilon/2$, there exists some $J$ such that $|a_{k_{j}}-s_{n}|\\lt \\epsilon/2$ for $j\\gt J$.  Thus, we see that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left|a_{k_{j}} - S\\right|\\leq |a_{k_{j}}-s_{n}| + |s_{n}-S| \\lt \\epsilon, ~ j\\gt J.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Therefore, $S$ is a cluster point of the original sequence, and thus there must be a subsquence which converges to it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Second Proof (from Lecture on 4/10):\n",
    "\n",
    "So here, we want to use the Greatest Lower Bound (GLB) property of the infimum and the Least Upper Bound (LUB) property of the supremum.  By this, we mean \n",
    "* (GLB) $\\forall \\epsilon\\gt 0 ~\\exists K\\gt n, ~ a_{K}\\lt s_{n} + \\epsilon$\n",
    "* (LUB) $\\forall \\epsilon\\gt 0 ~\\exists N \\in \\mathbb{N}, ~ S \\lt s_{N} + \\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, since $\\inf$ is a lower bound, we have that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_{n}\\leq a_{k}, ~ \\forall k\\geq n.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Thus, if we join this with the LUB property, we have shown that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\forall \\epsilon \\gt 0 ~ \\exists N \\in \\mathbb{N}, ~ S-\\epsilon \\lt a_{N+k}, ~ \\forall k\\geq 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, since $\\sup$ is an upper bound, we naturally have that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "s_{n} \\leq S. \n",
    "$$\n",
    "Thus, if we join this with the GLB property, we have shown that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\forall \\epsilon \\gt 0 ~ \\exists K \\geq n, ~ a_{K} \\lt S + \\epsilon.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine these results to get the final proof, we fix $\\epsilon$ and see that there is an $N$ such that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "S-\\epsilon \\lt a_{N+k}, ~ \\forall k\\geq 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "we can then find a $K_{0} = N+k_{0}\\gt N$ such that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "S - \\epsilon \\lt a_{K_{0}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and\n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_{K_{0}} \\lt S + \\epsilon.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Therefore we have shown that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left|a_{K_{0}} - S\\right| \\lt \\epsilon.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterating on this, we can find a $K_{1}\\gt K_{0}$ such that \n",
    "$$\n",
    "S - \\epsilon \\lt a_{K_{1}} \\lt S + \\epsilon,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and thus we can find a $K_{2}\\gt K_{1}$, and so on and so forth.  Thus we see $S$ is a cluster point of the sequence, and therefore it must be the limit of a subsequence. "
