But we can see that this is about as much as we can hope to easily say about the sequence since it should otherwise not be monotonic, and there is no obvious limit to which the sequence converged.  \n",

    "A thought provoking question though is whether $a_{n}=\\sin(n)$ oscillates fast enough such that the set of its cluster points is the entire interval $[-1,1]$.  How to show this one way or the other though is not straightforward.  To see why, suppose we wanted to show $0$ is a cluster point of $a_{n}$.  Well, to do that, we need to use the fact that $\\sin(m \\pi)=0$ for integer value $m$.  But $m\\pi$ is not a rational number, much less an integer, so which values of $n$ will get us near $m\\pi$?\n",

    "\\pi = 3.14159\\cdots a_{n-1} 0 a_{n+1} \\cdots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "so that $10^{n-1}\\pi - 314159\\cdots a_{n-1} = a_{n+1}/10^{2} + \\cdots$ so that \n",

    "\\sin\\left(314159\\cdots a_{n-1}\\right) \\approx \\frac{a_{n+1}}{10^{2}} + \\cdots\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Note, the first $0$ in the decimal representation of $\\pi$ happens at the 32nd digit (pretty sure), so $n=32$.  \n",
